# GRAVITATIONAL SIMULATOR

## What is this?
This is a personal project that I'm developing in python with pygame support to get used to them (being my first project in such platform). My objective is to learn as much as I can while developing something fun and interesting and to develop some basic tools that I can reuse in future projects.

It will be an interactive sandbox-like environment that simulates the gravitational attraction of the objects.

## Task List
- A Draw mode that allows you to initialize the position, size (mass) and velocity of the objects.

- First-order simulation algorithm.

- Development of some GUI that allows:
    - Interactive buttons
    - Scroll bars
    - Dropdown menus
    - Maybe more?

- Different objects possible (stars, planets, comets...) with different simulation properties and graphical differences to try as many interesting tools with pygame as possible. Maybe some blur to the stars and a particle generation for the comet tail.

- Higher-order simulation algorithms (Runge-Kutta) for better accuracy.

- Option to show the gravitational potential as a colour map in the background and/or contour lines of equal potential.

## Some other random ideas

- Predefined starting scenarios that show interesting or cool chaotic behaviour.

- Statistics of the temporal evolution of important quantities (total angular momentum, total energy, number of bodies...)

- Add an atmosphere thickness parameter that slows down other objects if they get in contact with it.
